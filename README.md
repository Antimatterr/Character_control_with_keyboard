# Moving-a-character-using-keyboard
This code shows how to move any charater or an object with the help of keyboard keys i.e ('W','A','S','D') in a console application just like a game purely based on logic without using classes and objects or you can say  without using OOP.
You can use this logic to build a simple snake game.
You can run this in any c/c++ compiler
